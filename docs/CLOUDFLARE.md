# Cloudflare deployment

The Cloudflare deployment runs the Vite webapp, browser-hosted game client, and the first
TypeScript API slices as one Worker. The game deliberately supports `LOCAL_BOT` only. OpenSky
identity is independent of blockchain wallets: Google OIDC is the first login provider, while
wallet connections are a separate, optional integration reserved for WalletConnect.

## Identity model

The D1 schema separates three concepts:

- `users` are OpenSky people and own the application session.
- `auth_identities` link login providers to users. Google is the first provider; additional
  providers can be linked without changing the user ID.
- `wallet_connections` link verified wallets to users. No wallet is required to create an OpenSky
  identity or play Practice.

The Google flow uses server-side OpenID Connect authorization code exchange, anti-forgery state,
PKCE, and a seven-day HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax OpenSky session cookie. OAuth access and ID
tokens are not stored.

## Build

Install the workspace dependencies, then run:

```sh
pnpm build:cloudflare
```

The build uses the `cloudflare` runtime profiles, builds both Vite packages, and assembles this
layout in `webapp/dist`:

```text
webapp/dist/
  index.html
  assets/
  game/cloudflare/
    index.html
    assets/
```

Set `RELEASE_VERSION` to use a different immutable game path:

```sh
RELEASE_VERSION=my-release pnpm build:cloudflare
```

The build also fails if an emitted file exceeds Cloudflare Workers' 25 MiB static-asset limit.

## Google OAuth configuration

Create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID with application type **Web application** in Google Cloud. Add this
production authorized redirect URI exactly:

```text
https://opensky-webapp.dysinski-tomasz.workers.dev/api/auth/google/callback
```

For a local Wrangler preview, also add the exact origin and callback printed by Wrangler, commonly:

```text
http://localhost:8787/api/auth/google/callback
```

Copy the Worker runtime template for local development and fill in the values:

```sh
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
```

`.dev.vars` is ignored by Git. Never commit the Google client secret or the production session
signing key.

The separate `.env.example` documents optional build and deployment values such as
`RELEASE_VERSION`, `GITCOMMIT`, and Cloudflare CI credentials. Copy it to `.env` only if your shell,
IDE, or CI system loads dotenv files; repository scripts do not automatically source `.env`.

The production Worker needs all three secrets:

```sh
pnpm --dir cloudflare exec wrangler secret put SESSION_SIGNING_KEY --config ../wrangler.jsonc
pnpm --dir cloudflare exec wrangler secret put GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID --config ../wrangler.jsonc
pnpm --dir cloudflare exec wrangler secret put GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET --config ../wrangler.jsonc
```

The multiplayer Workers additionally share an internal service credential, and the
game server needs a stable match-owner signing key. After all multiplayer Workers
have been created, provision both without printing their values:

```bash
pnpm provision:cloudflare:multiplayer-secrets
```

The command is repeat-safe. It preserves an existing match-owner key and refuses a
partially configured internal credential instead of generating mismatched secrets.
To intentionally rotate the shared credential on all four Workers, set
`CLOUD_WEASEL_ROTATE_INTERNAL_AUTH_SECRET=1` for that invocation.

The client ID is public by design, but binding both OAuth values through Wrangler keeps deployment
configuration together and avoids committing environment-specific identifiers.

## Local Cloudflare preview

Apply the D1 migrations before the first local run:

```sh
pnpm db:migrate:cloudflare:local
```

Then run:

```sh
pnpm preview:cloudflare
```

Open the URL printed by Wrangler. From the signed-out webapp, choose **Play Practice**, or open the
game directly:

```text
/game/cloudflare/?mode=LOCAL_BOT&skipAuth
```

When using a custom `RELEASE_VERSION`, replace `cloudflare` in that path with the chosen value.

## Deploy

The production Worker uses the `opensky-auth` D1 binding in `wrangler.jsonc`. On a new Cloudflare
account, create that database and replace the generated `database_id` in the configuration:

```sh
pnpm --dir cloudflare exec wrangler d1 create opensky-auth --config ../wrangler.jsonc
```

Apply migrations and configure the secrets above before deploying:

```sh
pnpm --dir cloudflare exec wrangler d1 migrations apply opensky-auth --remote --config ../wrangler.jsonc
pnpm deploy:cloudflare
```

Static requests use Cloudflare Assets with SPA fallback. Only `/api/*` is routed through Worker
compute first.

## Ported API surface

The identity-native routes are:

- `GET /api/auth/session` returns the current user, optional verified wallet links, and provider
  availability without exposing provider tokens.
- `GET /api/auth/google/start` begins Google OIDC with state and PKCE.
- `GET /api/auth/google/callback` completes Google OIDC and creates or updates the D1 identity.
- `POST /api/auth/logout` clears the OpenSky identity session.

The earlier Sequence ETHAuth-compatible RPC routes remain temporarily for legacy clients, but the
Cloudflare webapp no longer calls them, includes a Sequence project key, creates burner wallets, or
automatically registers wallet accounts.

The D1 data is isolated from the legacy Go/Postgres deployment, so legacy names, decks, inventory,
and progress are not migrated.

## Current boundary

- `LOCAL_BOT` simulates both players in the browser using the existing TypeScript/Wasm state code.
- Card and presentation assets still load from the configured external assets host.
- Google authentication and identity sessions are native TypeScript Worker services.
- WalletConnect linking and wallet-content reads are not implemented yet; the schema and session
  response keep them separate from login.
- `PRACTICE_BOT`, ranked play, multiplayer, decks, rewards, inventory, and legacy account-data
  migration still require additional service ports.
- `/matchmaker` remains reserved as a same-origin path for a later Durable Object/WebSocket slice.

## Suggested next slice

Add WalletConnect as an account-settings integration: connect a wallet, sign a nonce owned by the
current OpenSky session, persist the verified address in `wallet_connections`, and expose wallet
contents without granting that wallet authority over the user's login session.
